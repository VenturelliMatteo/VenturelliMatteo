### Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
I am an Engineering Physics MSc student at Politecnico di Milano with a strong passion for problem-solving :mortar_board:. Throughout my academic career, I have developed a very good knowledge of physics and programming, particularly in Python 🔭. In recent years, I have also been interested in machine learning and data science, and participated in several projects in these fields 🌱.

I previously worked with Giuseppe Urso and Lorenzo Trevisan (MSc students in Artificial Intelligence at Politecnico di Milano) to develop a [convolutional neural network for plant classification](https://github.com/ursogiuseppe/AN2DL-CNN-for-plant-classification) and a [convolutional neural network for time series classification](https://github.com/ursogiuseppe/AN2DL-CNN-for-time-series-classification).
I'm currently refining my skills in machine learning by tackling financial data science problems. Details can be found in [Fintech-Projects](https://github.com/VenturelliMatteo/Fintech-Projects) repository.
